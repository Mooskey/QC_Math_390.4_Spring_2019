## Dplyr

Now that we know piping, we can start adding some nice functions that manipulate data frames. Let's look at the diamonds dataset and load the dplyr library.

```{r}
data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
pacman::p_load(dplyr)
```

Let's remind ourselves of the dataset:

```{r}
str(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

The package `dplyr` offers many conveninent functions to manipulate, clean, put together data frames (AKA "munging", "wrangling"). It works really nicely with the piping chain as you "begin" the manipulation with the dataset and then iteratively do step 1, step 2, etc until you wind up with what end product you would like.

Beginning with the most obvious, `rename` will rename a column

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  rename(weight = carat)
```


The `select` function selects columns in the order you ask it to.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  select(cut, carat, price) #these three only in this order
diamonds %>% 
  select(carat, price, cut) #these three only
diamonds %>% 
  select(-c(x, y, z)) #leave out these three
diamonds %>% 
  select(-x, -y, -z) #leave out these three
```

If you want to rearrange the columns, you pretend to select a subset and then ask for everything else:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  select(carat, price, cut, everything()) #these three in this order first then everything else
diamonds %>% 
  select(-carat, everything()) #move carat last (first drop it, and then add it back in with everything)
```


The `arrange` method sorts the rows:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(carat) #default is ascending i.e. lowest first
diamonds %>%
  arrange(desc(carat)) #switch to descending, i.e. highest first
diamonds %>%
  arrange(desc(color), desc(clarity), desc(cut), desc(carat)) #multiple sorts - very powerful
```



The filter method subsets the data based on conditions:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal")
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal") %>%
  filter(depth < 65)
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal") %>%
  filter(depth < 65) %>%
  filter(x * y * z > 20)
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal" & depth < 65 & x * y * z > 20)
diamonds %>%
  filter((cut == "Ideal" | cut == "Premium") & depth < 65 & x * y * z > 20)
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut %in% c("Ideal", "Premium") & depth < 65 & x * y * z > 20)
```

How about removing all rows that are the same?

```{r}
diamonds
diamonds %>%
  distinct
unique(diamonds$carat) #there's only a few weight measurements that are possible...
diamonds %>%
  distinct(carat, .keep_all = TRUE) #keeps the first row for each unique weight measurement
```

Sampling is easy

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  sample_n(20)
0.0005 * nrow(diamonds)
diamonds %>%
  sample_frac(0.0005)
diamonds %>%
  slice(5000 : 5009)
```

There are many ways to reshape a dataset. We will see two now and a few functions later when it becomes important. For instance: we can collapse columns together using the `unite` function from package `tidyr`.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyr)
diamonds2 = diamonds %>%
  unite(dimensions, x, y, z, sep = " x ")
diamonds2
```

We can reverse this operation by separating them out using `separate`:

```{r}
diamonds2 %>%
  separate(dimensions, c("x", "y", "z"), sep = " x ")
```

Now for some real fun stuff. Let's create new features with the `mutate` function.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(volume = x * y * z) #adds a new column keeping the old ones (this was our exam problem)
diamonds %>%
  mutate(price_per_carat = price / carat) %>%
  arrange(desc(price_per_carat))
```

Or rewrite old ones.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(cut = substr(cut, 1, 1))
diamonds %>%
  mutate(carat = factor(carat))
```

Here are some more ways to create new variables:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(carat = factor(ntile(carat, 5)))
diamonds %>%
  mutate(carat = percent_rank(carat))
diamonds %>%
  mutate(lag_price = lag(price)) #if this data was a time series
diamonds %>%
  mutate(cumul_price = cumsum(price)) #%>% tail
```

There are tons of package to do clever things. For instance, here's one that does dummies:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjmisc, snakecase)
diamonds %>%
  to_dummy(color, suffix = "label") %>% #this creates all the dummies
  bind_cols(diamonds) %>% #now we have to add all the data back in
  select(-matches("_"), everything()) %>% #this puts the dummies last
  select(-color) #finally we can drop color
diamonds %>% #convert all to dummies
  select(color, cut, clarity) %>%
  to_dummy(suffix = "label")
```


What if you want to create a new variable based on functions only run on subsets of the data. This is called "grouping".

For instance:

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) #nothing happened... this just is a directive to dplyr to do things a bit differently now
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  mutate(price_rank_within_color = dense_rank(price)) #creates a new feature based on running the feature only within group
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  mutate(avg_price_for_color = mean(price)) #creates a new feature based on running the feature only within group
```

How do you summarize data within group?

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) #where did all the other columns go???
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price), sd_price = sd(price), count = n()) #where did all the other columns go???
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price), avg_carat = mean(carat)) #where did all the other columns go???
diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarize(min_price = min(price), med_price = median(price), max_price = max(price))
```

Putting it all together: ususally you're doing this manipulation get the dataset you want. Usually you're editing the dataset for real. Let's make a copy first:

```{r}
diamonds2 = diamonds
```

We first note that if we want to overwrite we can do:

```{r}
diamonds2 = diamonds2 %>%
  select(-x, -y, -z) %>%
  filter(carat < 0.5)
```

Or we can use a mutate operation that reads and writes simultaneously:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(magrittr)
diamonds2 = diamonds
diamonds2 %<>%
  select(-x, -y, -z) %>%
  filter(carat < 0.5) %>%
  arrange(carat, cut, color)
diamonds2
```

This is as far as we can go with dplyr right now given that this dataset doesn't have datetime information, some duplication among rows, missing data and given that there's not multiple dataframes. We will return to dplyr under these situations in the future.


# Functions of y

In the diamonds dataset, the natural response is price:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + geom_histogram(aes(price), binwidth = 200)
mean(diamonds$price)
sd(diamonds$price)
```

Look at the long tail here. Popular wisdom says to log this type of distribution as a log transform on the y variable would possible make the model more linear in x. It would be easier to catch the long tail. This is "craft lore" or a "trick of the trade". Let's take a look at the distributiona after logging:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + geom_histogram(aes(log(price)), binwidth = 0.03)
```

Some strange artifacts appear. Why the gap? Why is it "cut" at a maximum. These are questions to ask the one who collected the data.

Let's see if we get anywhere with this:

```{r}
lm_y = lm(price ~ ., diamonds)
lm_ln_y = lm(log(price) ~ ., diamonds)
summary(lm_y)$r.squared
summary(lm_ln_y)$r.squared
summary(lm_y)$sigma
summary(lm_ln_y)$sigma
``` 

Be careful when you use $g$ after logging, you will have to exponentiate the result. This is known to create bias because $E[Y]$ is different from $exp(E[ln(y)])$, but don't worry too much about this.

If you like this stuff, there are a whole bunch of transformations out there that are even cooler than the natural log. Some of this may be covered in 369 / 633. Let us use the log going forward:

```{r}
diamonds %<>%
  mutate(price = log(price))
```


# Linear Models with Interaction Terms

A natural increasing relationship will likely be found between weight and price. Let's see it visually:

```{r}
base = ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
base + geom_point()
```

Let's see a best guess linear relationship:

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat, diamonds)
b = coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
base + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept = b[1], slope = b[2], col = "green")
```

Let us add a third variable to this plot, color, a metric about the "yellowness" of the diamond. This is an ordinal categorical variable ranging from D (most clear i.e. best) to J (most yellow in this dataset i.e. worst).


```{r}
base +
  geom_point(aes(col = color)) + scale_color_brewer(type = "div")
```

We can look at this with faceting too:

```{r}
base +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ color, ncol = 3)
```


What do we see here? It looks like the slope of the price vs. carat linear model is affected by color. For instance, the "D" color diamonds' price increases much faster as weight increases than the "E" color diamonds' price increases in weight, etc. Why do you think this is?

We can picture two of these linear models below by fitting two submodels, one for D and one for J:

```{r}
mod_D = lm(price ~ carat, subset(diamonds, color == "D"))
b_D = coef(mod_D)
mod_J = lm(price ~ carat, subset(diamonds, color == "J"))
b_J = coef(mod_J)

base +
  geom_point(aes(col = color)) + scale_color_brewer(type = "div") +
  geom_abline(intercept = b_D[1], slope = b_D[2]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = b_J[1], slope = b_J[2])
```

This indicates a separate intercept and carat-slope for each color. How is this done? Interacting carat and slope. The formula notation has the `*` operator for this. It is multiplication in formula land after all!

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat * color, diamonds)
coef(mod) #beware: sometimes strange naming conventions on the interaction terms but seems to work here fine
```

The reference category is color D. This means every other color should start lower and have a lower slope. This is about what we see above.

How much of a better model is this than a straight linear model?

```{r}
mod_vanilla = lm(price ~ carat + color, diamonds)
summary(mod_vanilla)$r.squared
summary(mod_vanilla)$sigma
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

You can get more predictive accuracy out of this. We added a degree of freedom? Is this gain real? Yes. With one more feature and $n = 54,000$ there is no chance this gain came from overfit. Add 20,000 features, yes.

Let's take a look at carat with another variable, depth, a continuous predictor. High depth indicates diamonds are skinny and tall; low depth indicates diamonds are flat like a pancake.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = depth), lwd = 0.5) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rainbow(5))
```

It seems people like flatter diamonds and are willing to pay more per carat. Let's see this in the regression:

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat * depth, diamonds)
coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

If carat increases by one unit, how much does price increase by?

Is this better than the model without the interaction?

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

A tiny amount of increase.

How about cut?


```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = cut), lwd = 0.5)
```

Likely something here.

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat * cut, diamonds)
coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
mod = lm(price ~ carat + cut, diamonds)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

Yes.

Can we include all these interactions?

```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ carat * (color + depth + cut), diamonds)
coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
mod = lm(price ~ carat + color + depth + cut, diamonds)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

A decent gain once again.

What does the design matrix look like there? What is $p$?

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  model.matrix(price ~ carat * (color + depth + cut), data = .) %>% #note diamonds is not the first argument of `model.matrix` so I use the dot to pass in diamonds in the appropriate position
  head #you can see the strange naming convention here on cut for some reasons ... can't quite figure this out
```


Can we take a look at interactions of two categorical variables? BTW ... this is an answer to a lab question...


```{r}
plot1 = ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(col = price), lwd = 0.5) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rainbow(5))
plot1
```

Cool animation possible. May not work because it needs a ton of packages...

```{r}
pacman:::p_load_gh("dgrtwo/gganimate")
plot1 + transition_time(price)
```

Not so clear what's going on here. Let's see what the regressions say:


```{r}
mod = lm(price ~ color * cut, diamonds)
coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
mod = lm(price ~ color + cut, diamonds)
summary(mod)$r.squared
summary(mod)$sigma
```

# Cross Validation

This code gets the indices in a clever way:

```{r}
K = 5

all_idx = 1 : nrow(diamonds)
temp = rnorm(nrow(diamonds))
folds_vec = cut(temp, breaks = quantile(temp, seq(0, 1, length.out = K + 1)), include.lowest = T, labels = F)
```


Now let's fit a model on this $K$ times:

```{r}
s_e_s = array(NA, K)
for (k in 1 : K){
  test_idx = all_idx[folds_vec == k]
  train_idx = setdiff(all_idx, test_idx)
  #sort(c(train_idx, test_idx))
  mod = lm(price ~ ., diamonds[train_idx, ])
  y_test = predict(mod, diamonds[test_idx, ])
  y = diamonds[test_idx, ]$price
  s_e_s[k] = sqrt(sum((y - y_test)^2)) / (length(test_idx))
}
s_e_s
```



# Model Selection

We have now covered non-linearities (e.g. polynomial terms) and interactions. A new complication now clearly emerges. If I have $p$ predictors, there are many linear least squares models I can build (considering non-linear least squares models makes the space of models even larger!!)

For instance, here are a bunch of models:

```{r}
mod1 = lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds) #using a subset of the features
mod2 = lm(price ~ ., diamonds) #using a subset of the features
mod3 = lm(price ~ poly(carat, 2) + poly(depth, 2), diamonds) #using some polynomial terms
mod4 = lm(price ~ . * ., diamonds) #using all interactions
coef(mod1)
coef(mod2)
coef(mod3)
coef(mod4)
```

Which model is "best"? 

This is one of the most fundamental problems in statistics, and possibly all of science! 

In class, we discussed validation via dividing $\mathbb{D}$ into (a) a training set and a (b) testing set. Now, we will further divide the training set into (a) a sub-training set and a (b) selection set and we still have the (c) test set. 

The total training set together will fit a model and testing will estimate future performance. But within the total training set, we'll use an elaborate algorithim: we'll fit many models and take the best one. That's the "master algorithm".

We'll make the selection set and the test set the same size but we don't have to. First split up the data:

```{r}
n = nrow(diamonds)
K = 5
test_indices = sample(1 : n, size = n * 1 / K)
master_train_indices = setdiff(1 : n, test_indices)
select_indices = sample(master_train_indices, size = n * 1 / K)
train_indices = setdiff(master_train_indices, select_indices)
rm(master_train_indices)

#make sure we did this right:
pacman::p_load(testthat)
expect_equal(1 : n, sort(c(train_indices, select_indices, test_indices)))

diamonds_train = diamonds[train_indices, ]
diamonds_select = diamonds[select_indices, ]
diamonds_test = diamonds[test_indices, ]

rm(test_indices, select_indices, train_indices)
```

Now, fit all models and select the best one:

```{r}
mod1 = lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds_train) #using a subset of the features
mod2 = lm(price ~ ., diamonds_train) #using a subset of the features
mod3 = lm(price ~ poly(carat, 2) + poly(depth, 2), diamonds_train) #using some polynomial terms
mod4 = lm(price ~ . * ., diamonds_train) #using all interactions
```

Now predict on the selection set and look at the oos $s_e$, and select the "best" model

```{r}
yhat_select_mod1 = predict(mod1, diamonds_select)
yhat_select_mod2 = predict(mod2, diamonds_select)
yhat_select_mod3 = predict(mod3, diamonds_select)
yhat_select_mod4 = predict(mod4, diamonds_select)
y_select = diamonds_select$price #the true prices

s_e_s = c(
  sd(yhat_select_mod1 - y_select), 
  sd(yhat_select_mod2 - y_select), 
  sd(yhat_select_mod3 - y_select), 
  sd(yhat_select_mod4 - y_select)
)
names(s_e_s) = paste("mod", 1 : 4, sep = "")
s_e_s
#find the minimum
names(which.min(s_e_s))
```

Which are overfit? Which are underfit? Were these models "poor choices"?

Can we go back and fit some more models? 

Yes - as long as we don't open the "lockbox" of the test set. Let's look at one more model. An expansion of the best of the previous 4 models now with a couple interactions we are convinced are real plus a couple of non-linear terms:

```{r}
mod5 = lm(price ~ 
            . + 
            carat * color + 
            carat * depth + 
            I(carat^2) +
            I(depth^2),
          diamonds_train) 

yhat_select_mod5 = predict(mod5, diamonds_select)

s_e_s = c(s_e_s, sd(yhat_select_mod5 - y_select))
names(s_e_s)[5] = "mod5"
s_e_s
#find the minimum
names(which.min(s_e_s))
```

We can go further and fit more and more models but we should always be careful that we don't fit too many as we may optimize to the selection set. Here, we are lucky since the selection set is large (~11,000 observations) so this is not too much of a fear.

If we had more time in class, we would investigate how we can build better models by looking at the regressions controlled for all other variables. It is an art! 

But you can see the problem - how can we build a good model??

The answer to this is non-parametric regression. But first, we will cover two other important topics before we get there.

Let us return and complete the exercise by now declaring we are done modeling and we are going to ship model 5. Let us get a conservative estimate of its performance:

```{r}
yhat_test_mod5 = predict(mod5, diamonds_test)
y_test = diamonds_test$price #the true prices
sd(yhat_test_mod5 - y_test)
```

About the same as the selection estimate --- we did not overfit too much to the selection set.

At this point the lockbox is open and we can never return (if we are honest, of course - many people in this business lie so beware).

Now we can build production model 5 with all data to ship:

```{r}
mod_final = lm(price ~ 
            . + 
            carat * color + 
            carat * depth + 
            I(carat^2) +
            I(depth^2),
          diamonds)
```

No evaluation is done on the final model. It is only used to predict future diamonds' prices.
