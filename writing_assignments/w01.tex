\noindent It is your job to \textit{limit}, \textit{scope} and \textit{concretize} the above which are \textit{deliberately open-ended} and nebulous. You will need to formulate a model with phenomenon(s) that can be measured (explain how) and characteristics of the units under consideration. You will need to clearly define what \qu{models} are and discuss their limitations. In the appropriate context, you must write about the concepts we learned / will learn in class, including but not limited to $t ,f, g, h^*, \delta, \epsilon, e, t, z_1, \ldots, z_t, \mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}, n, p$, $x_{\cdot 1}, \ldots, x_{\cdot p}$, $x_{1 \cdot}, \ldots, x_{n \cdot}, \mathcal{X}, y, \mathcal{Y}$, extrapolation, interpolation, stationarity, overfitting, validation, model selection, machine learning, etc. \\
