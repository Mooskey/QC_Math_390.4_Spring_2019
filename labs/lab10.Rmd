First load the tree-building package:

```{r}
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx4000m")
# pacman::p_install_gh("kapelner/YARF", subdir = "YARF", ref = "dev")
pacman::p_load(YARF)
```

Let's take a look at the simulated sine curve data (i.e. the illustration I drew on the board last class)

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
n_train = 500
x_max = 10
x_train = runif(n_train, 0, x_max)
y_train = sin(x_train) + rnorm(n_train, 0, 0.3)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x_train, y = y_train), aes(x, y)) + geom_point(lwd=0.6) 
```

create a test set from the this data generating process with size 1000.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```


Fit a linear model to this dataset and test out of sample to get an idea of the generalization error.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Fit a tree to this dataset where nodesize is 25.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

How many nodes and how deep is this tree?

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Create an image of this tree's nodes and split rules.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Test this tree model's performance out of sample to get an idea of the generalization error.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Fit a tree to this dataset where nodesize is 1 and test out of sample.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Create M = 200 bootstrap samples of the data and save in a list.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Create a bag of M trees model where nodesize = 5 (the regression default).

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Test this bagged model out of sample.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Using the bootstrapped samples, find the oob error. This is hard!

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Fit a random forest model to the data. Report oob error.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

Test the random forest model out of sample. Is this error lower than the bagged model? Is the error similar to its oob error?

```{r}
#TO-DO
```



```{r}
